# Alpha: Go Launch a Survey!

### Building and Running

Install Go and ensure that your `GOPATH` env variable is set (usually it's `~/go`).

Note this app uses govendor (https://github.com/kardianos/govendor) to manage its dependencies.

```
go get -d github.com/ONSdigital/go-launch-a-survey/
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/ONSdigital/go-launch-a-survey/
go get -u github.com/golang/dep/cmd/dep
$GOPATH/bin/dep ensure
go build
./go-launch-a-survey

go run launch.go (Does both the build and run cmd above)

```

Open http://localhost:8000/

### Docker

The dockerfile is a multistage dockerfile which can be built using:

```
docker build -t go-launch-a-survey:latest .
```

You can then run the image using `SURVEY_RUNNER_SCHEMA_URL` to point it at an instance of survey runner.

```
docker run -e SURVEY_RUNNER_SCHEMA_URL=http://localhost:5000 -it -p 8000:8000 go-launch-a-survey:latest
```

The syntax for this will be slightly different on Mac

```
docker run -e SURVEY_RUNNER_SCHEMA_URL=http://docker.for.mac.host.internal:5000 -it -p 8000:8000 go-launch-a-survey:latest
```

You should then be able to access go launcher at `localhost:8000`

You can also run a Survey Register for launcher to load Schemas from

```
docker run -it -p 8080:8080 onsdigital/eq-survey-register:simple-rest-api
```

### Run Quick-Launch

For this to work ensure the JSON you are passing has an eq_id and form_type.
Run Survey Launcher

```
scripts/run_app.sh
```

Now run Go launcher and navigate to "http://localhost:8000/quick-launch?url=" passing the url of the JSON

```
e.g."http://localhost:8000/quick-launch?url=http://localhost:7777/1_0001.json"
```

### Deployment with [Helm](https://helm.sh/)

To deploy this application with helm, you must have a kubernetes cluster already running and be logged into the cluster.

Log in to the cluster using:

```
gcloud container clusters get-credentials survey-runner --region <region> --project <gcp_project_id>
```

You need to have Helm installed locally

1. Install Helm with `brew install kubernetes-helm` and then run `helm init --client-only`

1. Install Helm Tiller plugin for tillerless deploys `helm plugin install https://github.com/rimusz/helm-tiller`

To deploy to a cluster you can run the following command

```
./k8s/deploy_app.sh <RUNNER_URL> <DOCKER_REGISTRY> <IMAGE_TAG>
```

##### Example

```
./k8s/deploy_app.sh https://example.com  eu.gcr.io/census-eq-dev v1.0.0
```

### Tests

To run the unit tests, pass `go test ./... -cover -v` into the command line.
